# MEAN Boilerplate

## Getting Started

This boilerplate uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [bower](http://bower.io/), and [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). Make sure they are properly installed before continuing.

1. Install node packages.

```
npm install
```

2. Install bower packages. Note: Bower packages are installed in `public/bower_components`.

```
bower install
```

3. Run the default gulp task to start your server.

```
gulp
```

When your server is running you can go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.
